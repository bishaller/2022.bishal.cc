# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Bishal Mishra. I am a UX &amp; Product Designer, who
turns complex problem sets to simple solutions, focused to
build experiences.

I can Think, Solve, Invent, Design, Code, Manage, Lead and
most importantly, Learn. I have worn many hats, but currently
I lead all things product(s) and team(s) at Last Door, a B2B
Design and Development agency.

I am passionate about all areas of Design and Marketing. Being
a business studies graduate helps me blend the business side
with Design and make decisions as a product lead.

As of april 2022, I am learning to code and be consistent with 
it, which also sums up the in-progress version of my personal
site. Besides that, I'm a fun person to hang around. You can
find me on any social media with @bishaller username. Or,
let's just connect on linkedin.
